# Snake
This is a student-developed chess engine created as an exercise to learn the C
programming language. This project after I came across the
[Bitboard chess engine in C](https://youtu.be/QUNP-UjujBM) YouTube video
series while concurrently enrolled in NYU's Computer Systems Organizations
course (CSCI 201), which introduced me to the fundamentals of C programming.
The source code from the video series is available from
[the BBC repository](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc).
## Components
### Bitboard visualizer
[Bitboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard) programming is rather
complicated - I have developed a JavaScript companion tool to simplify the
process of generating the magic constants involved in the board manipulation
available [here](https://ishanpranav.github.io/snake-chess/tools/index.html).
The tool enables rapid visualization and experimentation.

I'd like to thank Kaylee Kim, Eric Ho, and Aren Balian ("Project Snake") for
supporting me on my journey (descent?) into the madness of bitboards.

# Snake
This is a student-developed chess engine that I created as an exercise to gain a
deeper understanding of the C programming language. NYU's Computer Systems
Organization course (CSCI-UA 201) first introduced me to C - my new favorite
language (after C#, of course). 

The Snake Chess engine is based on the implementation described in the
[Bitboard chess engine in C](https://youtu.be/QUNP-UjujBM) video. The source
code from the video series is available from
[the BBC repository](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc). 
## Components
### Bitboard visualizer
To visualize and understand the magic constants involved in bitboard
manipulation, I have created a companion web application available
[here](https://ishanpranav.github.io/snake-chess/tools/index.html). 
The tool enables rapid experimentation with bitboard data structures.

## Thanks
I'd like to thank Kaylee Kim, Eric Ho, and Aren Balian for supporting me on my
journey (descent?) into the madness of bitboards. "Project Snake" began as our
high-school aspiration in Irvine, California; this software hopes to make that
vision a reality in the form of a working UCI-compatible chess engine.

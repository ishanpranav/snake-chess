# Snake
This is a student-developed chess engine created as an exercise to learn the C
programming language. This project began by following along with the
[Bitboard chess engine in C](https://youtu.be/QUNP-UjujBM) YouTube video
series. The source code from the video series is available from
[the BBC repository](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc).
## Components
### Bitboard visualizer
Bitboard programming is rather complicated - I have developed a companion
JavaScript tool to simplify the process of generating the magic constants
involved in the board manipulation available
[here](https://ishanpranav.github.io/snake-chess/). The tool enables rapid
visualization and experimentation.
